# Project Gmail-UI

This is a simple Gmail App Clone, made to libs and trends:

[Nativewind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)- tailwind like approach
[Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/installation/#quick-start) - Folder router like in nextJs

## Notes

### Expo 50

Encountered a peculiar issue with the create-expo-app@latest on Android's VanillaIce version, which leads to unexpected crashes. This problem does not occur in an older project that was updated to the latest version of Expo, hinting that the issue may be linked to inadequate permission configurations in the startup boilerplate.

### Expo Router

The developer experience with Expo Router is generally positive, though it currently lacks robust support for scoped components close to their usage. This feature would greatly benefit larger projects by easing testing and enabling more efficient code-splitting. It is hoped that future updates will introduce improvements akin to those seen in the Next.js router.

### Nativewind

Integration with Nativewind has been extremely smooth, closely replicating the true Tailwind CSS experience. The transition to React Native nuances was seamless, providing an excellent developer experience.
